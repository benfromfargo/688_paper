  shorttitle = {Home {{Rule Be Damned}}},
  abstract = {In a time of increasing political conflict, attention is inevitably focused on Washington and the Trump White House. However, there are other important institutional fights across the country that are equally, if not more, important. These fights engage cities versus state governments over issues including gun control, environmental policies, nondiscrimination policies, and immigration, to name only a few examples. While partisanship plays a role in these conflicts (Republicans hold a majority of state legislatures and governorships and cities are predominantly led by Democrats), also at stake is the strength and vibrancy of federalism and representation of citizens whose views may differ substantially from the rest of the state. This Politics Spotlight addresses and analyzes these local-state conflicts from an academic perspective. Our goal is to motivate research that engages several crucial questions about the nature of conflicts between city and state governments. How common are these conflicts historically? Which governments typically have the upper hand and why? How important are they in shaping political institutions and the lives of ordinary citizens? What are their causes and causal mechanisms? The contributions to this Spotlight address these questions but also shed light on new avenues for research. The first three articles provide a general overview of these conflicts, with some useful hypotheses about their sources. The next articles provide historical and legal context to the issue. Our final three articles offer specific cases of policy conflicts.},

  volume = {70},
  copyright = {Copyright Stanford University, Stanford Law School Jun 2018},
  issn = {00389765},
  abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the emergence and rapid spread of a new and aggressive form of state preemption of local government action across a wide range of subjects, including among others firearms, workplace conditions, sanctuary cities, antidiscrimination laws, and environmental and public health regulation. Particularly striking are punitive measures that do not just preempt local measures but also hit local officials or governments with criminal or civil fines, state aid cutoffs, or liability for damages, as well as broad preemption proposals that would virtually end local initiative over a wide range of subjects. The rise of the new preemption is closely linked to the partisan and ideological polarization between red states and their blue cities. This Essay examines the spread of the new preemption and explores the legal doctrines available to local governments for challenging it. It argues that the more extreme preemption measures threaten the capacity for local self-government and are at odds with the values of local autonomy, the cornerstone role local governments play in our governmental structure, and the widespread state constitutional commitment to home rule. It also considers whether arguments about localism, like arguments about federalism, are really just about means to specific policy ends. It concludes that particularly in the current era of polarization, our system ought to protect some local space for self-determination for problems that arise at the local level.},

Since the early 1980s, declines in mortality in the United States have not kept pace with those in other high-income countries.1 Moreover, some parts of the United States and certain population subgroups, such as low-educated adults, have reportedly experienced increases in mortality.2 According to the US National Center for Health Statistics, between 2014 and 2015, life expectancy at birth for the nation as a whole declined by 0.1 year.3 Although that decline may ultimately prove tobea minor hiccup, it is a troubling indicator of the nation's current health. New York has imposed a hefty excise tax on cigarettes, implemented its own Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), participated in the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, and has not preempted local governments from implementing healthpromoting legislation such as paid sick days, a higher minimum wage, stricter firearm regulations, or requiring that calorie counts be posted.

New conceptions of state-local relations must account for the ways in which states mobilize public and professional opinion, districts orchestrate state and local priorities around schools and classrooms, and local political entrepreneurs influence state policy. The result is often that the local effects of state policy are greater than those one would predict on the basis of state capacity, and localities often gain influence as a result of state policymaking rather than lose it.},

The last few years have witnessed an explosion of preemptive legislation challenging and overriding municipal ordinances across a wide range of policy areas. State-city conflicts over the municipal minimum wage, LGBT antidiscrimination, and sanctuary city laws have garnered the most attention, but these conflicts are representative of a larger trend toward state aggrandizement. These legal challenges to municipal regulation have been accompanied by an increasingly shrill anticity politics, emanating from both state and federal officials. This Article describes this politics by way of assessing the nature of-and reasons for- the hostility to city lawmaking. It argues that anti-urbanism is a longstanding and enduring feature of American federalism and seeks to understand how a constitutional system overtly dedicated to the principles of devolution can be so hostile to the exercise of municipal power. The Article also provides a current accounting of state preemptive legislation and assesses the cities ' potential legal and political defenses. It concludes that, without a significant rethinking of state-based federalism, the American city is likely to remain vulnerable.},
