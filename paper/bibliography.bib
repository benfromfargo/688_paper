  abstract = {In a time of increasing political conflict, attention is inevitably focused on Washington and the Trump White House. However, there are other important institutional fights across the country that are equally, if not more, important. These fights engage cities versus state governments over issues including gun control, environmental policies, nondiscrimination policies, and immigration, to name only a few examples. While partisanship plays a role in these conflicts (Republicans hold a majority of state legislatures and governorships and cities are predominantly led by Democrats), also at stake is the strength and vibrancy of federalism and representation of citizens whose views may differ substantially from the rest of the state. This Politics Spotlight addresses and analyzes these local-state conflicts from an academic perspective. Our goal is to motivate research that engages several crucial questions about the nature of conflicts between city and state governments. How common are these conflicts historically? Which governments typically have the upper hand and why? How important are they in shaping political institutions and the lives of ordinary citizens? What are their causes and causal mechanisms? The contributions to this Spotlight address these questions but also shed light on new avenues for research. The first three articles provide a general overview of these conflicts, with some useful hypotheses about their sources. The next articles provide historical and legal context to the issue. Our final three articles offer specific cases of policy conflicts.},

  volume = {70},
  copyright = {Copyright Stanford University, Stanford Law School Jun 2018},
  issn = {00389765},
  abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the emergence and rapid spread of a new and aggressive form of state preemption of local government action across a wide range of subjects, including among others firearms, workplace conditions, sanctuary cities, antidiscrimination laws, and environmental and public health regulation. Particularly striking are punitive measures that do not just preempt local measures but also hit local officials or governments with criminal or civil fines, state aid cutoffs, or liability for damages, as well as broad preemption proposals that would virtually end local initiative over a wide range of subjects. The rise of the new preemption is closely linked to the partisan and ideological polarization between red states and their blue cities. This Essay examines the spread of the new preemption and explores the legal doctrines available to local governments for challenging it. It argues that the more extreme preemption measures threaten the capacity for local self-government and are at odds with the values of local autonomy, the cornerstone role local governments play in our governmental structure, and the widespread state constitutional commitment to home rule. It also considers whether arguments about localism, like arguments about federalism, are really just about means to specific policy ends. It concludes that particularly in the current era of polarization, our system ought to protect some local space for self-determination for problems that arise at the local level.},

Since the early 1980s, declines in mortality in the United States have not kept pace with those in other high-income countries.1 Moreover, some parts of the United States and certain population subgroups, such as low-educated adults, have reportedly experienced increases in mortality.2 According to the US National Center for Health Statistics, between 2014 and 2015, life expectancy at birth for the nation as a whole declined by 0.1 year.3 Although that decline may ultimately prove tobea minor hiccup, it is a troubling indicator of the nation's current health. New York has imposed a hefty excise tax on cigarettes, implemented its own Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), participated in the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, and has not preempted local governments from implementing healthpromoting legislation such as paid sick days, a higher minimum wage, stricter firearm regulations, or requiring that calorie counts be posted.

The result is often that the local effects of state policy are greater than those one would predict on the basis of state capacity, and localities often gain influence as a result of state policymaking rather than lose it.},

The last few years have witnessed an explosion of preemptive legislation challenging and overriding municipal ordinances across a wide range of policy areas. State-city conflicts over the municipal minimum wage, LGBT antidiscrimination, and sanctuary city laws have garnered the most attention, but these conflicts are representative of a larger trend toward state aggrandizement. These legal challenges to municipal regulation have been accompanied by an increasingly shrill anticity politics, emanating from both state and federal officials. This Article describes this politics by way of assessing the nature of-and reasons for- the hostility to city lawmaking. It argues that anti-urbanism is a longstanding and enduring feature of American federalism and seeks to understand how a constitutional system overtly dedicated to the principles of devolution can be so hostile to the exercise of municipal power. The Article also provides a current accounting of state preemptive legislation and assesses the cities ' potential legal and political defenses. It concludes that, without a significant rethinking of state-based federalism, the American city is likely to remain vulnerable.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Until the nonsmokers' rights movement, tobacco control activity was at the federal or state levels, which is where the tobacco industry dominates. Since the appearance of the nonsmokers' rights movement, progress in tobacco control has occurred primarily at the local level. In response to the success of this movement, the tobacco industry has developed "smokers' rights" groups and other tactics to fight local legislation. Several recent local campaigns in California illustrate these tactics. Tobacco control forces follow many paths, from sitting on the sidelines to making a serious commitment to smoking control legislation. Despite the tobacco industry's superior financial resources, the outcome of proposed local tobacco control legislation appears to depend on how seriously the health advocates mobilize in support of the local legislation. When the health community makes a serious commitment of time and resources, it wins. When it fails to make such a commitment, the tobacco industry prevails, more by default than by its superior financial resources.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}(\emph{JAMA}. 1991;266:2110-2117){$<$}/p{$>$}},

This finding is robust to a number of alternate specifications and hypotheses. Ideology appears to play an important role in the decision to involve the state in the affairs of local governments.},

In this article, I show how conservative activists within the Republican Party have leveraged cutbacks to union rights to weaken their political opponents. This case study thus reveals the role of policy feedback strategies in asymmetric partisan polarization. It also illustrates lessons about the conditions under which policy feedback can durably shift the distribution of power in America's fragmented polity. These insights underscore how the success of policy feedback effects depends not just on the initial passage of policies in one city or state, but on the ability of political actors to organize in multiple venues simultaneously. In particular, they highlight the importance of organizing at the cross-state level given the substantial political authority of states.},

This research asks whether state courts limit local authority in areas in which local preferences differ from the state's, and whether this is conditioned by the level of autonomy the state grants the local government. Using a newly constructed data set of 404 local governments that had local ordinances challenged in state courts between the years 1996 and 2017, we find that local governments with citizen ideological preferences that differ from the state are less likely to have an ordinance preempted by the courts when the level of local autonomy given by the state is high. Thus, institutions like home rule provide local governments with certain legal protections from challenges to local authority.},

A model is constructed to analyze the impact of these constraints on local action regarding minimum wage and hypothesize that greater constraints will result in less policy action within cities.

We find that, in the aggregate, the policy liberalism of U.S. states steadily increased between the 1930s and 1970s and then largely plateaued. The policy liberalism of most states has remained stable in relative terms, though several states have shifted considerably over time. We also find surprisingly little evidence of multidimensionality in state policy outputs. Our new estimates of state policy liberalism have broad application to the study of political development, representation, accountability, and other important issues in political science.},

A scholar or governmental expert was selected in each state to prepare the state descriptions. Each chapter follows the same outline of content that allows easy comparison between states.  In an era of power and responsibilities devolving from the national government to states and localities, the use of home rule powers has become increasingly important to the health of American government and federalism.

The former refers here to the power of localities to function free from the oversight authority of higher tiers of the state. The latter principle refers to the power of localities to legislate and regulate the behavior of residents.

  abstract = {Introduction. Preemption is a legislative or judicial arrangement in which a higher level of government precludes lower levels of government from exercising authority over a topic. In the area of smoke-free policy, preemption typically takes the form of a state law that prevents communities from adopting local smoking restrictions. Background. A broad consensus exists among tobacco control practitioners that preemption adversely impacts tobacco control efforts. This paper examines the effect of state provisions preempting local smoking restrictions in enclosed public places and workplaces. Methods. Multiple data sources were used to assess the impact of state preemptive laws on the proportion of indoor workers covered by smoke-free workplace policies and public support for smoke-free policies. We controlled for potential confounding variables. Results. State preemptive laws were associated with fewer local ordinances restricting smoking, a reduced level of worker protection from secondhand smoke, and reduced support for smoke-free policies among current smokers. Discussion. State preemptive laws have several effects that could impede progress in secondhand smoke protections and broader tobacco control efforts. Conclusion. Practitioners and advocates working on other public health issues should familiarize themselves with the benefits of local policy making and the potential impact of preemption.},
